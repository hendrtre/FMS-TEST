The point of this app is to provide the backend for my Freedom Mailing Services website application. 

Right now it provides storage for makeing, editing, and deleting simple text that can be stored and rendered back. 
Eventually I will make it capable to handle images as well. 

This also has the ability to create and store user interfaces. Alowing the feature for a admin to come in and make changes to the database on the front end and save the new edits back to the front end. 

This has been pushed up to Heroku
